# iaml2017_R

I'm enrolled as a class-only student on the Introductory Applied Machine Learning (INFR10069) course at the University of Edinburgh's School for Informatics. The labs for this course are carried out using Python. As I just recently started using R, I've decided to carry out the labs using R, rather than learning to use Python at the same time!

The instructions and questions for these labs can be found at https://github.com/JamesOwers/iaml2017

Any instructions in my .Rmd files given in **bold** are copied from James' instructions in the above link.

This repository contains my solutions to the labs using R, I'll upload them as I go along. There are some questions that I struggled to translate from Python to R - any suggestions/improvements would be much appreciated!
